# Bookinfo Istio Example Application
 
The [bookinfo](https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/)example deploys a sample application composed of four separate microservices used to demonstrate various Istio features. The application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.
